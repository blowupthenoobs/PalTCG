This was made trying to help my friend get a video game sim for his card game. Which you can read about here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CPb4od1YCOKHCiYINA3jWyQQ8xmLcY1hjhPDVc1e4fs/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p

Didn’t manage to make too much visual flair by the end of SOM, so it’s kinda barebones for now, but all the cards there have some sort of functionality. For that same reason, there’s no tutorial, so you’d have to read the linked doc to understand it.

Click on a card in your hand, then the corresponding space to play it to bring up a prompt to place the card down.
Clicking on a friendly card during the main phase will open the card context menu. Left is for palskills, middle is for activated abilities (of which none exist atm,) and the right button is to bump cards off their spot.
The buildings also have interactions for you to use, clicking on the red button lets you see your own resources.
Press space to go to the next phase.
During the attack phase, you can click on one of your units, and then an opponent’s unit to begin a raid.

I think that’s should be all the controls that need to be explained, though there’s also pressing P to pause the game.


If you would like to open up the project on your computer, you would need to clone the repo, and find the filepath with the unity hub. If you don’t have my version, it’ll prompt you to switch or download the version, either of which should work.
